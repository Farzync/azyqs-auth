# Azyqs-Auth

A modern, production-ready authentication and account management platform built with **Next.js 15**, **React 19**, **Prisma ORM**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
This project delivers secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication features, including:

- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with TOTP & backup codes
- WebAuthn (passkey) support for passwordless login
- Interactive, detailed audit logging (track all user/security events)
- Modern, accessible UI/UX (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS)
- And much more!

> **Why Azyqs-Auth?**
>
> - Real-time, filterable audit log for all user actions (login, profile changes, MFA, passkey, etc.)
> - Secure backup code management (regeneration only if MFA is active, all actions logged)
> - Designed for SaaS, internal tools, or any app needing robust authentication

## üöÄ Description

**Azyqs-Auth** is a robust authentication starter kit and reference implementation.  
It demonstrates best practices in user security, modern UI/UX, and developer experience.  
**Key highlight:**

> **Interactive Audit Log:** Users can monitor all account activity (login, profile changes, MFA, passkey, etc.) in real-time, with device, IP, status, and error details‚Äîdirectly from the UI.

## üÜï Latest Updates

- **WebAuthn (Passkey) Support:** Register and login with passkeys for passwordless authentication.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** TOTP-based MFA with backup codes (backup codes can only be regenerated if MFA is active; all actions are logged).
- **Interactive Audit Logging:** Monitor all account activity (login, profile changes, MFA, passkey, etc.) in detail and in real-time from the UI. Every important action, success or failure, is logged with timestamp, device, IP, and error (if any).
- **ReCAPTCHA Integration:** Protect login and registration from bots.
- **Modern UI:** Built with Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, and custom components.
- **Improved Security:** CSRF protection, JWT-based sessions, secure password hashing, and more.
